  <p><strong>The right sized equipment for tall and short persons in military  service</strong> (summary)</p>
  <p>Written by Pekka Vilhunen</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>In 1993 The Finnish Army made an extensive research measuring 3634  soldiers serving in three different military units. The measuring included:  age, height, weight, head measure round, neck measure round, chest measure  round, width of the back, waist measure round, hip measure round, length of the  back, sideline measurement, inseam, arm length, hand measure round and hand  length. Yearly about 30 000 men serve their national duty in the military.  Results told that there were men shorter than 165 cm  1,6 % (=480), taller than 190 cm 5,5 % (=1650) and taller than  195 1 % (=300). The possibility for women to serve in the military has  increased the need of smaller sizes. </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>The Finnish Army has fairly big and small sized equipment in store:  rubber boots 35-53, winter boots 36-47, landing boots 35-52, jogging shoes  35-52, camouflage gear 644-868, overall 646-966, hat 54-62, T-shirt S-XXXL,  long johns XS-XXXL, overcoat XS-XXXXXL. In case there are no suitable equipment  in store the army will purchase a built-to fit one. Approximately five persons  per year need these. Built-to-fit special orthopedic footwear are lent out to  the user when he ends his service. When he is called for rehearsals he must  take them with.</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>At the moment it takes from one to two weeks to have all the needed  equipments for a special sized soldier. The army is considering of measuring  all recruits in the drafting, so the equipment could be delivered to the  garrisons before the arrival of the new recruits.</p>

  <p><strong>Increasing neck and shoulder symptoms among youth . focusing in seating  ergonomics</strong> (summary)</p>
  <p>Written by Arja Rimpelä, Professor of National Health Institute</p>

  <p>According to a research made from 1996 by questioning 8th    and 9th year comprehensive school students and 1st  secondary school students 10% of them have daily neck / back pains and one  third suffered them weekly. Reasons for this situation can be found in reducing  physical exercise and increasing use of computer as well as in the fact that  the young persons grow mature earlier than couple decades ago. This puts  enormous demands for having right kind and sized chairs and desks in schools.  Most of those used in schools today wouldn.t pass any inspection in any adult  workplace.</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>We studied a new kind of chair and desk combination manufactured by  Easydoing Oy. As skeptic researchers we didn.t buy the manufacturer.s  assurances of the Salli saddle-chair and adjustable chair, but when our own  annoying</p>
  <p>neck and back symptoms vanished we began to believe that this kind of  workplace could be worth testing also in school environment.</p>
