  <h1>Female measures 2001  .project results</h1>
  <p>Aamulehti 27.08.2001</p>

  <p>The research was done by The Department of Physiology,  The Laboratory of Clothing Physiology, of  The University of Kuopio. During the two year project 1550 women between 15 and  84 years of age were measured. The research defined six female body types and  created size charts for them. The project created new height charts for these  six body types. There are now six height classes between 152 .176 cm.</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>Until now, we have had just two height  classes for female clothes in Finland (160 cm ± 4 cm and 168 ± 4 cm) and only one of them has been  used by the manufacturers. It seems it is a combination of these both suiting  those between 160 and 168 cm. These new categories admit that there are women  shorter than 156 and  taller than 172  cm, but only four centimeters each way. Those truly short or tall are still  forced to find their own way. It.s still a start, don.t you think.</p>

  <p><strong>A small car causing a small problem</strong> </p>
  <p>Helsingin Sanomat 26.11.2001, .Weird event. .column, a story by Tuija  Sairio</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>Back in 1960s. I was on a local bus coming from Puistola and headed for  Helsinki city center. It was a bright summer day. The bus stopped by the Malmi  cemetery to pick up a passenger. Just when it was leaving the bus stop there  was a thump.</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>A small car had started from a company yard on our right and has  clashed to the front bumper of our bus.</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>The bus stopped and the bus driver, a tall and sturdy man, stood up  calmly, pulled the front door open, and said to the small car.s driver: .The  pram should be lifted in through the back-door.. After a brief clearing the  driver came back in, straightened his cap and the travel continued.</p>
