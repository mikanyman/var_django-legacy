<P>SECURING THE RIGHTS OF A MINORITY GROUP AND </P>
<P>EQUALITY AMONG THE FINNISH CITIZENS</P>

<P>Dear Mr Gunnar Jansson.</P>

<P>We are a group of Finnish citizens whose fundamental services are not at the same level with the corresponding services of the rest of the Finns. The lack of services makes our lives more difficult in many ways. For this reason, we are now appealing to you for assistance in improving the state of affairs. </P>

<P>The Tall &amp; Small Association is a nationwide family organisation. The height of our members and the size of their footwear differ considerably from the standards which industrial manufacturing is based on. The Finnish association is a member of the worldwide Tall Clubs organisation formed by corresponding organisations in EU member countries and the USA. In proportion to the population, the Finnish association is . as far as we know . the largest organisation of this type in the world. In connection with international meetings, for example in Luxembourg 29.5. - 4.6.2000, it has come out that purchasing clothing, footwear and other products in exceptional sizes is a common problem in all member countries to people like the members of our organisation. Unsuitable clothing and footwear cause physical and psychological problems and financial difficulties to our members. </P>

<P>According to various estimations, the share of &quot;overtall&quot; people in our population is about 10% (500,000 people) and the number of small people is about 5% (250,000 people). This <B>minority group </B>experience, for example, the following kinds of problems in their everyday lives: </P></DIR>

</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Availability and prices of consumer goods (including footwear and clothing)</LI>
<LI>Lack of variety of physical exercises including physical education at school (sizes of clothing, footwear and equipment are unsuitable) </LI>
<LI>ergonomics (in schools, workplaces, homes)</LI>
<LI>construction standards (including furniture, location of beds)</LI>
<LI>standard of equipment in public buildings (schools, hospitals, garrisons, jails)</LI>

<LI>public transport</LI>
<LI>traffic safety (regulations in cars are insufficient, family cars of average prices are small . compare with motor tax)</LI>
<LI>lack of working and safety devices in all necessary sizes (restricts vocational selection).</LI></UL>
</UL>


<P>Need for international task group </P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Now we are asking you to have an influence on that the defects encountered by our minority group would be mapped as soon as possible. To this end we suggest to nominate a task group, preferably common for all EU member countries, to design improvements in the lives of tall and small people. It is obvious that many of such potential improvements would need government support. Besides, Finland could be an initiator in international co-operation. </P>

<P>In the Tall Clubs. meeting in Luxembourg on the 1<SUP>st</SUP> of June 2000, a core group of five countries was nominated in order to draw up measures for achieving our goals. From many member countries, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Holland, and Switzerland were chosen to the core group. </P>

<P>Entrepreneur.s point of view</P>

<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>According to the information received from entrepreneurs themselves, firms and shops offering outsized and exceptional lengths encounter many kinds of problems in servicing our members, for example:</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Manufacturers specialising in outsized and exceptional lengths are few as industry is only interested in mass production. </LI>

<LI>Domestic selection is too modest and narrow, for example, models mainly provided for elderly people are the only choice offered to retailers from year to year. Models are not changing since manufacturers assume that there is no demand for their products. </LI>
<LI>Manufacturers add as much as 25% to the price of products in special sizes compared to the normal sizes, as the products must be produced in small lots and practically they are handwork. </LI>
<LI>For example, <U>for a pair of shoes manufactured by Mantereen Kenk&auml;tehdas in the size of 48 the portion of VAT to be paid to the state is in marks more than that for a 46 size since the purchase price is higher. </LI>
</U><LI>Thus retail prices are considerably higher than the prices of products in normal sizes for the fact that pricing is based on actual expenses.</LI>
<LI>In spite of high consumer prices the coverage to retailers offering products in special sizes is less than specialised shops have in general in order to avoid extremely high prices. </LI>
<LI>Orders are received by retailers selling special sizes at a later stage of seasons for the reason that products in outsized and exceptional lengths are only manufactured after the mass production.</LI>
<LI>Customers are few, the velocity of products is longer than normally, and too much money is tied up with the stock. </LI>
<LI>Late products, bad availability of goods in general, high prices, long purchasing trips, and inequality with other customers irritate consumers.</LI></UL>

</UL>


<P>Consumer.s point of view</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Firms servicing the dominant population are not interested in offering products to tall and small people but supply relies on few specialised shops located in southern Finland.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>


<UL>

<UL>
<LI>Shopping trips are long and expensive </LI>
<LI>Consumer prices are high: "I would buy more provided that prices were lower."</LI>
<LI>Unemployed, single parents, pensioners, people in poor health, students, and other people suffering from financial difficulties have no means to buy extremely expensive products</LI>
<LI>Working people have their normal salaries but for essential goods they have larger expenses than other citizens have</LI>
<LI>Tall or small size tends to pass on throughout the family which increases expenses manyfold</LI>
<LI>Tall and small people are passed by because of their size in work, leisure activities and other social situations </LI>
<LI>Medical problems resulted by growth matters</LI>

<LI>Products must be durable, for example, footwear must have a strengthened sole  </LI>
<LI>Models and colours are few: "Why should I buy the same product from year to year?"</LI></UL>

<P>We kindly ask you to take care of the availability of services to the members of our minority group in order to avoid a situation where our position would get even worse because of the fact that economic effectiveness and rationalisation are becoming dominant values in our society. Thank you.</P>

<P>Helsinki, </P>
