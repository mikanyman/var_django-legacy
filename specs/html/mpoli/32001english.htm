  <p><strong>Nordic walking</strong> (summary)</p>
  <p>by Suvi Helanen, Physiotherapist, Nordic Walking Instructor, Special  Physical Training Instructor</p>

  <p>Nordic walking is an excellent form of aerobic work-out. It suits also  those with problems with balance, knees, angles etc. Compared to normal walking  it.s 20-30 % more efficient and combined with pole-, wrist- and ankle-weights  up to 50 %. The nordic walking reminds of the classic cross-country skiing.  Hand move close to the body. Hands are stretched almost straight on push and in  the front the pole hits the ground on approximately 75 degrees angle to the  level of the toes of the opposite foot.</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>The poles should be shorter than in cross-country skiing. The forearm  should be horizontal and the elbow should form a 90 degree angle when holding  the pole in 90 degree angle to the ground. The length of the pole can be  calculated by multiplying the length of the user by 0,72 (for example person  130 cm long should use poles 0,72 x 130 cm=93,6 cm long or person 220 cm long  should use poles 0,72 x 220 cm=158,4 cm long). Nordic walking poles can be  found in every sport store and sport department in Finland. Lengths vary from  95 to 145 cm. Manufacturers are ready to deliver special sizes also. If a tall  persons club should order a larger amount of poles at once the price shouldn.t  differ significantly from the normal retail price. Special orders can be made  to sport stores, but it maybe better to contact the manufacturer direct.</p>

  <p><strong>Car interiors for tall persons: search continues</strong> (summary)</p>
  <p>by Ari-Jukka Eskelinen, Industrial Designer MA, Vice president Tall And  Small Association Finland</p>

  <p>Some interesting new cars have came to the market since the  test-reports in Tekniikan Maailma .magazine. My one person test group (193  cm/shoe 46) is a little harder on cars than the TM test family, because I try  to fit to the left back seat after I adjust the driver seat to the best  possible driving position for me first. Some of the new models have improved  front spaces to tallish person because of the higher body. Unfortunately the  most seats are still made to fit persons sizes M to L. And it seems impossible  for car designers to understand that the leg of the driver should fit between  the pedals and the steering-wheel. For a tall family the situation hasn.t  changed much. You should get a full size space car or a cross-country vehicle  in order to have enough head and knee room in the back seat. And pay the higher  price, maintenance costs and fuel bills, and just to be considered  environment-hostile for driving such a big car. So much for the equal rights.</p>
