  <p><strong>The seat</strong> (not the Spanish one)</p>
  <p><em><u>Longitudinal adjustment</u>:</em> One should check if the seat can be  adjusted so that the angles of both the knees and ankles are reasonably open.  Too sharp angles cause not only discomfort, tiredness and possible long term  damage, but they make the fast and accurate moving of the feet from one pedal  to an other hard or even impossible.</p>
  <p><em><u>Height adjustment:</u></em><em> </em>A must, because the fixed  seats are assembled in an average medium person height and therefore without it  the distance between the seat and the ceiling is too small.</p>
  <p><em><u>Seat tilt adjustment</u></em> offers better thigh support to longer legs  and simultaneously reduces the need of longitudinal adjustment making reach  distance to the steering wheel and dashboard shorter and leaves extra leg room  for the rear passengers.</p>
  <p><em>Combined height and tilt adjustment:</em> Quite nice even when only  the rear end is adjustable like in some VW:s. Separate adjustments as in some  Volvos give even better range of adjustments.</p>
  <p><em><u>Adjustment of the back rest:</u></em> I think this is a standard  equipment in all modern cars, some older American cars do have non-adjustable  back rests. Stepless adjustment is better both because it gives more  opportunities and it can be changed during driving without fear of collapsing  into sleeping position. On should also check out that the back rest can be  turned enough straight upward position so that the steering wheels is in  comfortable reach.</p>
  <p><em><u>Adjustable lumbar support</u></em><em>:</em> an important  equipment to tall persons because the original supports of the seats are in  wrong places. Although the lumbar support is usually positioned too low the  possibility of adding or reducing it can help the situation. Some models have  lumbar support that can be adjusted at two different heights.</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h1>The head rest</h1>
  <p><em>Fixed head rests</em> are almost always too low. Closest to reasonable  are in some Volvos. </p>
  <p><em>The height adjustment:</em> one should check if the rest leaves too far  back to offer any support in case of an accident.</p>
  <p><em>The tilt adjustment</em> helps reducing the distance between the rest and  back of the head.</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h1>Steering wheel</h1>
  <p><em>Height adjustment </em>is the more common one, but the less useful. If the  angle of the wheel changes much, it means that the more important top half of  the wheel escapes further away from the driver when in upper position. Mainly  it just helps getting in and out of the vehicle.</p>
  <p><em>The longitudinal adjustment</em> should be fixed by law as  the only way to adjust the distance between the wheel and the pedals suitable  for both ends of the height scale.</p>
  <p><em>Combined adjustment</em> for a tall person: the wheel should be taken out as  much as possible, but the height adjustment can also be something else than the  upper most one.</p>
  <p>Driver should be able to place his both wrists at the same time to the  top (12 o.clock) of the steering wheel while his shoulders are slightly pressed  to the back rest. Be sure to see the speedometer well.</p>
