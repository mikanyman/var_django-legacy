<p>This is an English homepage of Tall &amp; Small Association, Finland. 
  Our association was established on October 21, 1995 by
  Maiju Havinen from Lappajärvi. She is the chairman of the association.
  After 10 years we have over one thousand members, about 800 tall and 200 short.
  Only small amount of our members are tall or short because of diagnozed syndrome
  or disease. We are co-operating with Marfans and Little People,
  and some have also joined our club.Some of the members are not that short
  or tall, they have extreme shoesize. 
  We are just the size what we are, and proud of it! And, we are not alone.
  There are a lot of <b>tall clubs in the world!</b> Many of them, over one hundred,
  have home pages. Tall &amp; Small Association in Finland belongs to the 
  European Organization of Tall Clubs.
  We are also a member of <a href="http://www.alli.fi"><b>Finnish Youth Alliance</b></a>.</p>
  
<p>The original purpose of the association was primarily to find and transmit 
  information about shoe shops that sell big and small shoes, but since the persons
  that have small or big shoes are also shorter or taller than 
  people generally things spread out to clothes very quickly. 
  There are some shops that sells clothes and/or shoes with 
  special sizes, but their addresses are not always commonly known.
  We are now able to help also those who are not living in big 
  cities or nearby these kinds of stores.
  
  Very soon we also noticed other problems conserning height challenged people. 
  Many of them in a same situation as handicapped, 
  or even worse when it comes to equality issues 
  if one is without a proper diagnose for heights
  Our tallest young male is 218cm tall with up to shoesize 60,
  and tallest female is around 200cm with shoesize 51.
  Shortest adult female is 138cm (nondiagnozed), and male around height 150cm.
  Smallest adult shoesizes are 31 for female and 36 for male.</p>

<p>
  The association is also pressuring 
  Finnish authorities, manufacturers and suppliers to try to make them to understand height challenged.
  We try to make a world a little nice a place to everyone, 
  especially if it is a question of safety and legal issues . We have 
  been quite succesful so far.</p>
