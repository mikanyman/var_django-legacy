  <p><strong>The BFG</strong> (as The Big Friendly Giant by Roald Dahl)</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>.What is your favorite color?. .Blue., answered Sami Eerola with a  surprised smile on his lips, when the first question on the interview wasn.t  about his height or related to it. 32 years old Sami Eerola is as far as we  know the tallest Finn alive at the moment (218 cm, petite shoe size 50).</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>As a teenager Sami interested in sports and was soon snatched to a  basket ball team. He has played on the highest level in Finland in The  Uudenkaupungin Urheilijat .team. Now he plays in Pispalan Tarmo. In the army he  had to wait a couple of weeks to get the equipment, but finally he was quite  satisfied with them. With a little wink in his eye Sami said that he always  reserved the place next to the tent door in field exercises in order to stick  his head out the door to avoid his feet getting burned by the stove in the  center.</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>Sami lives in a king sized kindergarten. At home the cupboards under  the table level are used only as a long term storage room. Only the upper  cupboards are in reasonable reach. His trusty bicycle is a lifesaver, because  he can.t fit into busses neither sitting nor standing.  The list continues: must leave the door of  the toilet open because the knees don.t fit in, remember to bend down in each  door and read most of the public sign downward.</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>At the moment Sami is studying to be a carpenter. He won.t need any  scaffolding to do the panelling of the ceiling in a standard room. We also  tried how he would fit into a small space car Toyota Yaris Verso. In the driver  seat Sami fit just and just, but driving any longer would not be wise. Toyota  would make a quite a nice and reasonable priced car by adding more adjustment  range to the front seats and the longitudinal adjustment to the steering wheel.  In the back seat things were surprising: after removing the floor cover plates  there was room enough for Sami to travel comfortable even when the driver is  193 cm long. </p>

  <p><strong>Spesiaali Koot A&amp;O Oy</strong> </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>Our club activist Arja Partanen left the safe life of a civil servant  and started a shop for tall and big footed persons. The shop is in Tullintorin  kauppakeskus close to the railway station and Tampere-talo (a conference and  music hall) in Tampere. Speciaali Koot sells clothes for tall girls, women,  boys and men, and shoes (female sizes 42-48 and male sizes 46-55).</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>For ladies Arja has a good selection of clothes and shoes from leisure  wear to business clothing not to forget teenage trends. And the best of all:  you can have both clothes and shoes in a quite a variety of colors, not just  black, brown and beige.</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>For men Arja sells mostly leisure and casual wear, because the business  and formal wear can be found in a couple of other shops. As with ladies you can  find more colors and unexpected styles in these sizes. And the best part  visiting Spesiaali Koot is of course meeting Arja herself: a colorful, joyful  and wonderful person.</p>
